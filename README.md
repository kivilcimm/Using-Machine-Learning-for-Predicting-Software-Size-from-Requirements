# Using-Machine-Learning-for-Predicting-Software-Size-from-Requirements

In this project, worked on answer of the question: "Can a system be automated to provide accurate results in COSMIC and Event Point measurements using deep learning methodology and NLP algorithms?".

Firstly, in order to create a sufficiently large and accurate dataset, appropriate use cases were collected from 15 projects, and then the whole dataset was measured according to the Cosmic  measurement methodology and the Event Point measurement methodology. Then, in order to create a model that can make automatic measurement estimation, the bert_base_uncased NLP model was trained with the train set and measurement estimation was made on the test set.
